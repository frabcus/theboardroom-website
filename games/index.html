            <p>Bet on a camel race, build your own zoo, settle a new continent!
            These are not your usual board games - they're carefully chosen to
            be fun to play with a clear, dramatic ending. Many of the games are
            winners of the German "Spiel Des Jahres" (Game of the year) - a
            highly prestigious award. Below is a description of some of the
            available games to play. 
            </p>

                <p><img src="/img/box-camel-up.png" class="game-image pull-right">
                Winner of the Spiel des Jahres in 2014. In Camel Up, up to 8 players can bet on
                five racing camels, trying to guess which one will score first place on a track
                around a pyramid. The earlier you place your be the more you can win. However,
                camels don't run neatly....sometimes they land on top of one another and hitch
                a lift across the finish line. Who's going to run when? It all depends on the
                dice.</p>

                <h2>Ca$h 'N Gun$</h2>
                <p><img src="/img/box-cash-and-guns.png" class="game-image pull-right">
                In an abandoned warehouse, a band of gangsters are splitting
                their latest haul, but they can't come to an agreement on the
                split. It's time to let the gins do the talking, and soon
                everyone is aiming at everyone...</p>

                <p>All you have to do it stay alive and have the most money at the
                end of the game! Ca$h 'N Gun$ will make you relive the best
                scene from gangster movies and other modern detective stories,
                where the flimsiest excuse serves to let bullets fly! Fun,
                bluff and negotiations are to be had. Thing is, do you have
                enough guts to play? This is a game where laughter isn't the
                only deadly thing....</p>

                players develop the area around Carcassonne and deploy their
                followers on the roads, in their cities and in the fields. The

                The goal of concept is to guess words through the association of icons. A team
                of two players - neighbours at the table, chose a word or phrase that the other
                players need to guess. Acting together, the team places pieces judiciously on
                the available icons of the game board. To get other to guess "milk" for
                example, the team might place the pieces on the icons "food/drink", "white" and
                "liquid". The first player to correctly guess receives two victory points. The
                winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.

                this game, smart sewing lets you reap rewards. Plant the beans you do want,
                trade the ones you don't want to other players. Adding to the realism of the

                Each player takes a turn being the story teller and tells a story about one of
                their images. Each player then pics an image from their hand which matches the
                story tellers story. Players must then guess which card belongs to the
